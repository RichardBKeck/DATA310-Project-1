 ''' markdown
 
 1. You're about to get on a plane to Boston. You want to know whether it is raining. You call 4 random friends of yours who live there and ask each one independently, if it's raining. The first two of your friends have a 1/2 chance of telling you the truth and, the other two have 1/4 chance of messing with you by lying. All 4 friends tell you that "No" it isn't raining. What is the probability that it's raining in Boston?
